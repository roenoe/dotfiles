# This is an example of how you can manage your monitors. Copy this file to ./monitors.conf to use it.

# https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors 
# See `hyprctl monitors` for monitor names and capabilities

# Examples
#monitor = [NAME], [RESOLUTION]@[FRAMERATE], [POSITION], [SCALE], transform, [0|1|2|3]

# I reccommend not using negative numbers, as that can mess with X11 windows running under xwayland
#monitor = DP-1, 3840x2160@120, 1440x300, 1
#monitor = DP-2, 2560x1440, 0x0, 1, transform, 1
#monitor = DP-3, 2560x1440, 5280x0, 1, transform, 1

# Workspaces
workspace = 1, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true, default:true
workspace = 2, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true 
workspace = 3, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true 
workspace = 4, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true 
workspace = 5, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true 
workspace = 6, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true 
workspace = 7, monitor:DP-1, persistent:true 

# To disable a monitor
#monitor = [NAME],disable

# Mirror
#monitor=DP-3,1920x1080@60,0x0,1,mirror,DP-2
#monitor=,preferred,auto,1,mirror,eDP-1
